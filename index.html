		<h2>Information</h2>
		<p>feeeels ...is a publication that explores art, culture, politics, history, and emotions through the lens of one <b>tactile adjective</b> per issue. Visual and written works from over 25 contributors investigate the role of tactility in an increasingly flat and digital age.</p>
		<p>The first issue, <a href="fuzzy">feeeels—fuzzy</a>, slated for release this fall, will be published both in print and online.</p>
		<p><a href="fuzzy">feeeels—fuzzy</a> tackles the concept of “fuzzy” from a myriad of critical perspectives. Written and visual pieces explore timely and timeless topics including fuzzy politics, foggy memories, language shifts, playful interactions between strangers, and clashes between modernism and cultural traditions. Our contributors hail from a range of professional backgrounds—art, design, medicine, history, and sports mascots—and seven different countries, coming together in conversation through a common lens. In its unique and multi-faceted framework, the publication highlights established and rising thinkers and makers, with often surprising interjections. At a moment when tactility is disregarded in pursuit of sleek, supposedly immaterial, digital interactions, we foreground it as a necessary foundation for understanding the 21st century. </p>
